# RoboticMobilityAnalyzer

## Introduction
This is a collection of ChatGPT-generated code for analyzing the mobility of parallel mechanisms. The code repository serves as supplementary material for the paper "A ChatGPT Framework for Mobility Analysis of Parallel Mechanisms."

## Environment Requirements
- **Python Version**: 3.12
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `numpy` 1.26.1
  - `sympy` 1.12
    
## Supplementary Codes

- **Code S1**: Script for Calculating the Mobility of Sarrus linkages in Fig.4a.
- **Code S2**: Script for Calculating the Mobility of Spherical 4R parallel mechanism in Fig.4c.
- **Code S3**: Script for Calculating the Mobility of 3-RRCR parallel mechanism in Fig.4e.
  
## Installation Guide
Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed, and use the following commands to install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.1
pip install sympy==1.12
